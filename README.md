<sub>Uploaded: May 8, 2021, by: Adonis Santos</sub>


This is a project made to complete the lesson at: https://www.theodinproject.com/

To play the game, you will need to enter the console of the browser either by clicking `ctrl + shift + j` / `cmd + option + j`, right click and select inspect element>go to console tab, or pressing `ctrt + shift + i` / `cmd + option + i` and go to console tab.

A prompt will show when you go to the link to either enter rock, paper, or scissor. You will be playing with a computer and the game will last until someone reach 5 points. Once you reach 5 points, the game will end and will declare a winner.

At the moment, the game will need to be played through the console of a browser but at a later point, a UI will be added to easily interact with the game.
